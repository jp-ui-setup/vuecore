In Vue 3, the lifecycle of a component refers to the series of events that happen from the moment a component is created to the moment it is destroyed. Vue 3 introduced the Composition API, which provides a more flexible and powerful way to manage component state and lifecycle events, in addition to the traditional Options API (which is still supported).

Here’s a breakdown of the **Vue 3 lifecycle methods** using both the **Options API** and **Composition API**:

### 1. **Lifecycle in the Options API**:

In the Options API, lifecycle methods are defined within a component object.

#### Key Lifecycle Methods:

- **`beforeCreate`**:
  - Called **before** the component is created.
  - At this stage, the component instance is not yet available, so properties like `data`, `computed`, or `methods` are not accessible.
- **`created`**:
  - Called **after** the component instance is created.
  - The `data` and `methods` are available, but the DOM is not yet rendered.
- **`beforeMount`**:
  - Called **before** the component is mounted (before the DOM is rendered).
- **`mounted`**:

  - Called **after** the component is mounted.
  - The component's DOM is now rendered, and you can perform DOM-related tasks here.

- **`beforeUpdate`**:
  - Called **before** the component is updated due to a reactive data change.
- **`updated`**:

  - Called **after** the component has been updated.
  - This is useful for performing actions after the DOM has been re-rendered.

- **`beforeUnmount`**:
  - Called **before** the component is destroyed.
- **`unmounted`**:
  - Called **after** the component is destroyed.

Here’s an example of how to use these lifecycle methods in the Options API:

```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0,
    }
  },
  beforeCreate() {
    console.log('beforeCreate')
  },
  created() {
    console.log('created')
  },
  beforeMount() {
    console.log('beforeMount')
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log('mounted')
  },
  beforeUpdate() {
    console.log('beforeUpdate')
  },
  updated() {
    console.log('updated')
  },
  beforeUnmount() {
    console.log('beforeUnmount')
  },
  unmounted() {
    console.log('unmounted')
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    },
  },
}
```

### 2. **Lifecycle in the Composition API**:

In the Composition API, lifecycle hooks are provided as functions that you can use within the `setup()` function. These hooks are more flexible and can be used in combination with the reactivity system.

#### Key Lifecycle Hooks in Composition API:

- **`onBeforeMount`**:

  - Equivalent to `beforeMount` in the Options API.
  - Called **before** the component is mounted.

- **`onMounted`**:

  - Equivalent to `mounted` in the Options API.
  - Called **after** the component is mounted.

- **`onBeforeUpdate`**:

  - Equivalent to `beforeUpdate` in the Options API.
  - Called **before** the component is updated due to reactive changes.

- **`onUpdated`**:

  - Equivalent to `updated` in the Options API.
  - Called **after** the component is updated.

- **`onBeforeUnmount`**:

  - Equivalent to `beforeUnmount` in the Options API.
  - Called **before** the component is unmounted.

- **`onUnmounted`**:

  - Equivalent to `unmounted` in the Options API.
  - Called **after** the component is unmounted.

- **`onErrorCaptured`**:
  - Called when an error is captured during the component lifecycle (useful for error handling).

Example using the Composition API:

```javascript
import {
  ref,
  onBeforeMount,
  onMounted,
  onBeforeUpdate,
  onUpdated,
  onBeforeUnmount,
  onUnmounted,
} from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)

    onBeforeMount(() => {
      console.log('onBeforeMount')
    })

    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('onMounted')
    })

    onBeforeUpdate(() => {
      console.log('onBeforeUpdate')
    })

    onUpdated(() => {
      console.log('onUpdated')
    })

    onBeforeUnmount(() => {
      console.log('onBeforeUnmount')
    })

    onUnmounted(() => {
      console.log('onUnmounted')
    })

    const increment = () => {
      count.value++
    }

    return {
      count,
      increment,
    }
  },
}
```

### Summary of Lifecycle Methods in Vue 3:

| **Lifecycle Method**  | **Options API** | **Composition API** |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| **Before Creation**   | `beforeCreate`  | N/A                 |
| **Created**           | `created`       | N/A                 |
| **Before Mounting**   | `beforeMount`   | `onBeforeMount`     |
| **Mounted**           | `mounted`       | `onMounted`         |
| **Before Update**     | `beforeUpdate`  | `onBeforeUpdate`    |
| **Updated**           | `updated`       | `onUpdated`         |
| **Before Unmounting** | `beforeUnmount` | `onBeforeUnmount`   |
| **Unmounted**         | `unmounted`     | `onUnmounted`       |
| **Error Captured**    | N/A             | `onErrorCaptured`   |

### When to Use Which?

- **Options API**: If you're comfortable with the more traditional object-based syntax or are working in a project that already uses the Options API, this might be more familiar and simpler.
- **Composition API**: If you prefer a more modular and flexible approach to organizing your code, especially when you need to reuse logic across components, the Composition API is a better fit. It allows for a more functional and reactive approach.

Both the Options API and the Composition API can coexist in the same project, allowing you to gradually transition to the Composition API if desired.
