The error **"Component provided template option but runtime compilation is not supported in this build of Vue"** occurs because, by default, Vue 3 uses the **runtime-only** build, which doesn't include the template compiler. This means you cannot directly use templates in `.vue` files unless Vue is configured to use the **full build**, which includes both the runtime and the compiler.

Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:

### Solution 1: Use Vue's Full Build (Runtime + Compiler)

1. **Change Vue to Full Build**

   You need to ensure that your project is using the **full build** of Vue that includes the template compiler. In a typical Vue CLI setup, this is handled automatically, but in some cases (such as when you import Vue directly in a CDN or use custom configurations), you might be using the runtime-only build.

   To fix this issue, you can explicitly install and use the **full build** of Vue. Here's how to do it:

   - **Install the full build of Vue** by running:

     ```bash
     npm install vue@next
     ```

     This ensures that the version of Vue you're using is the correct version (Vue 3) that supports runtime + compiler.

2. **Check Vue Build Mode**

   If you're using a custom build of Vue (e.g., through a CDN), make sure you are loading the **runtime + compiler** build. You can switch from the runtime-only build to the full build.

   For example, if you're using Vue via a CDN, change the URL to the full build:

   ```html
   <!-- Replace with the full build of Vue -->
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@next"></script>
   ```

   If you're using Vue CLI, the full build is already handled for you, so you don’t need to worry about this.

### Solution 2: Pre-compile Templates with `vue-loader`

If you're using **Vue 3** with **TypeScript** and a build system like **Webpack**, you likely need to configure the `vue-loader` to pre-compile the templates at build time.

1. **Install Dependencies**

   First, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   npm install vue-loader@next @vue/compiler-sfc --save-dev
   ```

2. **Configure Webpack**

   In your `webpack.config.js`, ensure that you have `vue-loader` configured to handle `.vue` files. Here's an example configuration:

   ```js
   const { VueLoaderPlugin } = require('vue-loader')

   module.exports = {
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.vue$/,
           loader: 'vue-loader',
         },
         {
           test: /\.ts$/,
           loader: 'ts-loader',
           options: {
             appendTsSuffixTo: [/\.vue$/],
           },
         },
       ],
     },
     plugins: [new VueLoaderPlugin()],
   }
   ```

3. **Add the Template Compiler** (Optional)

   Ensure that Vue is configured to support the runtime + template compilation:

   ```ts
   import { createApp } from 'vue'
   import App from './App.vue'

   createApp(App).mount('#app')
   ```

   With `vue-loader` and `@vue/compiler-sfc` set up, the template will be precompiled at build time, avoiding the need for runtime compilation.

### Solution 3: Use a `.ts` File for the Template (without using `template` option in Vue component)

If you prefer to avoid template compilation altogether, another option is to split your `.vue` components into `.ts` and `.html` files, especially if you're not using the full build of Vue. This method involves writing your component templates in HTML files and importing them into your TypeScript files.

For example:

1. **Create a `.html` file for your template**:

   ```html
   <!-- src/components/MyComponent.html -->
   <div>
     <h2>This is a custom component from the plugin</h2>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Import the HTML file as a template in your `.ts` component**:

   ```ts
   // src/components/MyComponent.ts
   import { defineComponent } from 'vue'
   import template from './MyComponent.html'

   export default defineComponent({
     name: 'MyComponent',
     template, // Use the HTML as the template
   })
   ```

   You’ll need to use a loader that supports importing HTML templates directly into TypeScript files (e.g., `html-loader` or custom configuration for webpack).

### Solution 4: Use `vite` with Vue 3 and TypeScript (Recommended)

If you're starting a new project or willing to transition, **Vite** is an excellent alternative to Webpack and it has built-in support for Vue 3, TypeScript, and template compilation.

To set up a Vue 3 project with TypeScript using **Vite**, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Vite project with Vue 3 and TypeScript**:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-vue-app --template vue-ts
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd my-vue-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Vite will automatically handle the Vue 3 templates and compilation process for you.

### Conclusion

To resolve the **"Component provided template option but runtime compilation is not supported in this build of Vue"** error:

- If you're using **Vue CLI**, ensure that you have installed `@vue/compiler-sfc`, and it should automatically handle template compilation.
- If you're using **Vite**, it automatically handles template compilation with Vue 3, so there’s no need to manually configure it.
- If you're using a custom build or CDN, ensure you're using the **runtime + compiler** build, not the runtime-only version.

By following the correct setup for your build tool (Webpack, Vite, or CDN), you should be able to resolve this error. Let me know if you need more assistance!
